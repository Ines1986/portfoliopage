<p>I was raised in the beautiful, rainy, bicycle city called Amsterdam - where I still live to this date. A few years ago I finished my Masters at The University of Amsterdam in Work and Organizational Psychology, after completing my research and thesis about 'the influence of seeing the color red on a person's creativity'. It turns out, there's no need in painting your office red (unless you really like red ofcourse!). Since then I have mostly been working in Human Resources in my hometown. 

<p> However a few years ago I started noticing that every single person in Amsterdam is working in IT (I might be overexaggerating a tiny bit). So recently I started to follow the crowd, and did my first programming course. And I found out that I also love coding.

<p>On a personal note; I enjoy travelling all over the globe, modern boardgames/ puzzles & escape rooms/ treasure hunts, other quirky activities like trampoline dodgeball, going to stand up, reading and writing postcards,  .. and a I do a lot of coding ofcourse!

<p id="fun"> Fun fact! : During my psychology studies I learned about "implicit egotism". It states that people prefer people, places, and things that they associate (unconsciously) with the self, because of peopleâ€™s positive automatic associations about themselves. Research has proven that this also can effect people's career choice's. For example: people with "den" in their names, have a significantly higher chance to end up as a dentist then any other occupation. - Have you noticed that my initials are IT?
